2. Watch the videos
3. Establish meeting times


## 01/10/2020
### Overview:
The main objective of the meeting was to establish workloads for everybody for the week of 01/10/2020.
 
### To Do:
- **Ruben**: Writing proposal for drone kit for us to get familiar with the start-to-finish process of already working drone/code. Contacting Galois to confirm what parts of the IMU (or if all 3) are essential for us in case we don't need all 3 sensors.
- **Bliss**: Getting started on the .stl files in src/main/startup and speaking with the company or Roy about getting the HiFive boards .stl file.
- **Eric**: Finding a drone kit that will accommodate the size of the HiFive Board | Makefile research.
- **Niko**: Makefile research.

Everyone:
- Build the firmware at least once for one of the boards. (Basically figure out how to get the code fully compiled for one of the pre-existing targets).
- Use the files under **docs** for help. **docs/Customized Version.md**  and **docs/development** one of the files in that folder.

Note: Also please remember to try and build a easily visualized map for the rest of us as you figure something out (like what is important to focus on in the MakeFile)

### Done:
- Watch the videos that Eric has uploaded
- Establish meeting times

### Goals:
- This week we need to:
1. Send proposal for drone kit to Galois (to get familiar with the start-to-finish process of already working drone/code).
2. Confirm requirements for IMU device with Galois.
3. Look into startup file for FE310-G002 (where to get .S file?).
4. Begin researching drone kit that will accommodate the size of the HiFive Board (width = 51 mm).
5. Begin looking into Makefile (what is does/ how it works).

### Next meeting: Monday, 01/13/2020 6:00pm - PSU: Circuits Lounge
