## Notes:

### General Notes:

- Giving Project Proposal presentation at Galois Inc. Friday, Feb. 27
- Update from Michal - amazon cart with drone kit and other items arrive 2/18. Also, the sifive boards should be available by 2/21
- Got Amazon parts but waiting to meetup with Roy to receive them.

- Discussed feedback from Cleanflight developers/maintainers who were suggesting Betaflight is what we should focus on and questions to ask Galois about it.

### Questions for Galois:

- For the final deliverable “pull request” does Galois intend for us to merge with CleanFlight proper or Galois fork of Cleanflight and what are the constraints for a “accepted” pull request?
- Ask Michal about keeping receipts for purchased products to speed up item acquisition.
- Ask about meeting up with Galois more often.
- Bring up findings about Betaflight.
- When did Galois create their fork of Cleanflight.
